This React app fetches an API from an external website and creates a multiple choice question type quiz. The user can input the difficulty and the number of questions to be generated by the app.

(The API sometimes outputs coded text, which is not caused by this app. But it should be readable for the most part).

(The API was also causing react to throw an error whenever I was trying to access an array within an array grabbed from the json file - as in the array incorrect_answers[0][0]. I have tried changing the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) which did not work here. I have had to rewrite the code in a particular way for the app to fetch the json data without causing it to crash).

The react code is in src folder named App.js.
The CSS code is in src folder named index.css.
Copy these files to the src folder created by Create React App in the local folder to access the app with npm start.
